Welcome to the Water System Samples.
The [WaterSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/WaterSystem.html) allows you to add water to your scenes. 
Multiple water presets are available, this scene showcases the customisation of a Pool.

Please use the HDRP Asset Settings Helper buttons to make sure the project is set up properly otherwise some features might not be visible.

• Screen Space Reflection on Transparent is enabled in the HDRP Asset, it allows us to see various reflections on the water surface.

• To define the pool's shape and position, we are using a Custom Geometry Type. Linked objects are disabled but can be inspected under the Geometry group. 
• Enabling Directional Shadow in the Caustics section allows you to dim the caustics effect in the directional shadow areas.
• There's also an underwater effect. To define what’s considered underwater, we placed a BoxCollider on each Water object.
• The {beach_ball}(Ball) sticks to the kidney pool Water Surface using the FitToWaterSurface script.
