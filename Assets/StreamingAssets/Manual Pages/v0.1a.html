    <h3>Warning, this game uses Raytracing and DirectX12, this will not run on non-raytracing cards currently. (You can still probably run the name generator though in the main menu)</h3>
    
    <p>First release, all this includes in the Name Generator in the menu and a test scene with 2 animatronics.</p>
    
    <p>Name Generator is just a fun little thing to mess with that generates random store names. It takes a full random name (or anything you type in) and spits out... the best it can. This is gonna be used later in the game for random NPC names and random business names for competing restaurants. I'm gonna have similar variants of the name generator for animatronic manufacturers and other specific named things.</p>
    
    <p>The test scene depicts an extremely small location that will be runnable in the game, alongside 2 identical robots that are testing the first iteration of the DEAD Engine. Press #1-3 to move the first bot, and uhhhhh #4-5 aren't working on the other one but #6 does I guess. Current movements are just using basic animation, no air simulation yet.</p>
    
    <p>Use WASD to move around and EQ to fly, just gonna be a simple fly camera for now until collision begins working n such.</p>
    
    <p>If the scene starts to slowly darken that's cause a cloud is moving in front of the sun. Game's fully raytraced so stuff like that's gonna happen. The sun's position currently doesn't move though.</p>
