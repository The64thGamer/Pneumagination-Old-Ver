Pneumagination is an open source sandbox game focused on the automation of stores and entertainment venues. Players gather resources, build, and attract customers during the day. The night brings forth dangers from the dark, with a rare chance some creatures may want to purchase your wares with exotic goods. Advance your technology to enhance the guest experience and automate your builds as you construct across the land, and eventually towards new horizons.
