Pneumagination is a work-in-progress animatronic restaurant simulation game, where you create your own animatronic-filled store and compete in the market.

The game will focus on modular animatronic creation, and won't provide any pre-built characters for you. Its up to you to create your band and keep your restaurant in the market.

Everything in the game will be randomly generated upon starting a world- your starting locations, the companies to build animatronics for you, competing restaurants, random events, ect.. It will be up to you to earn money and grow your skill tree to unlock more ways to personalize your restaurant.

### The Usual Simulator Fun

As is tradition with my animatronic simulators, the main focus of the game is creating showtapes and watching your bots perform. The tools developed in the orignal RR Engine will now be made more accesible for your animatronic symphonies. The jump to complete band creations however means you'll have many more tools to play with in crafting the perfect stage.

### Discord Server

If you wanna discuss Pneumagination with other people you can join my personal [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/yTXtR4S3mF). Users subscribed to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/The64thGamer) will see work-in-progress development before commits are pushed to the Github and officially announced. Releases and development will also be detailed on my [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/the-64th-gamer).

### General Plans

Plans are to develop this game publically and freely for the first part of development, sort of a free Early Access, and when the game gets closer to completion I'll put it on Steam while still leaving the free version up. Steam version will also have an open source codebase, but asset files will be locked behind a purchase. I wanna make sure the game is as open and moddable as possible, alongside having the DEAD Engine be easily used in other animatronic projects if users would like to.

# DEAD Engine
A completely rewritten from scratch animatronics engine based off what was learned from the RR Engine. The Digital Emulators of Animatronic Devices Engine seeks to be more modular than RR and become more of a framework for others to implement their own code to control it. DEAD Engine scripts are going to be completely detatched from the Pneumagination game, and are accessible in Assets/Scripts/DEAD.

The engine is also going to focus on bringing more physics-accurate simulations to animatronics, focusing on simulated airflow for cylinders, depleting air in air tanks, and shakiness with large movements. Modders will also have an easier time setting up animatronics with new automated Animation Controller creation.
